Episode 4:

Still recovering from their lost man, the roboitcists 


  They knew they couldn't hold out much longer. The zombies were approaching and although they did know the 
  school better, they were in no position to hold off an army of hungry zombies. They had to think fast. The Liam 
  experience was not one they wanted to repeat. Just as everyone was begginning to fret, Nathaniel ran out of the
  compsci lab flying! He had made himself a pair of batman wings.
  
  "Let's GOOOOOOO!!!" Nathaniel shouted as he flew through the hall. 
  
  The students stared at him in disbeleif. This was just what they need. 
  
  "We've got this" shouted one student. 
  "Let's go kill some zombies!" exclaimed the other. 
  
  While they were still mourning the loss of their loved one, the students proceeded full speed ahead. They
  ran to the elevator and waited. After a few minutes the elevator came and the students took it down to three.
  The doors opened
